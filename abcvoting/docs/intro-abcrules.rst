ABC rules
=========

Approval-based committee rules (ABC rules) are voting methods for selecting a committee,
i.e., a fixed-size subset of candidates.
ABC rules are also known as approval-based multi-winner rules.
The input of such rules are
`approval ballots
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting>`_.
We recommend the book
`Multi-Winner Voting with Approval Preferences <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795>`_ [1]_
by Lackner and Skowron as a detailed introduction
to ABC rules and related research directions.
In addition, the
`survey by Faliszewski et al. <http://research.illc.uva.nl/COST-IC1205/BookDocs/Chapters/TrendsCOMSOC-02.pdf>`_ [2]_
is useful as a more general introduction to committee voting (not limited to approval ballots).

The main ABC rules implemented in `abcvoting` are the following:

.. testsetup::

    from abcvoting import abcrules

.. doctest::

    >>> for rule_id in abcrules.MAIN_RULE_IDS:
    ...     print(f"{rule_id:40s}{abcrules.get_rule(rule_id).longname}")

The short identifiers on the left side are the respective `rule_id`'s.

In addition to these rules, there are Thiele methods, Sequential Thiele methods,
and Reverse Sequential Thiele methods. These are classes of ABC rules and
are parameterized by arbitary scoring functions (explained in detail here [1]_).
For example, the 3-Geomtric Thiele method (with `rule_id` being `"geom3"`) as well as
Sequential 3-Geometric (`rule_id="seqgeom3"`) and Reverse Sequential 3-Geometric (`rule_id="revseqgeom3"`)
are implemented but not specifically listed above.

.. doctest::

    >>> for rule_id in ["geom3", "seqgeom3", "revseqgeom3"]:
    ...     print(f"{rule_id:20s}{abcrules.get_rule(rule_id).longname}")
    geom3               3-Geometric Rule
    seqgeom3            Sequential 3-Geometric Rule
    revseqgeom3         Reverse Sequential 3-Geometric Rule

abcvoting
=========

`abcvoting` is a Python library of approval-based committee (ABC) rules.
ABC rules are also known as approval-based multi-winner rules.
The input of such rules are
`approval ballots <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting#/media/File:Approval_ballot.svg>`_.
We recommend the book
"`Multi-Winner Voting with Approval Preferences <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01795>`_"
by Lackner and Skowron as a detailed introduction to ABC rules and related research directions.
In addition, the
`survey by Faliszewski et al. <http://research.illc.uva.nl/COST-IC1205/BookDocs/Chapters/TrendsCOMSOC-02.pdf>`_
is useful as a more general introduction to committee voting.

Method of Equal Shares (aka Rule X) with Phragmén phase
-------------------------------------------------------


Phase 1:

starting budget:
  (3/4, 3/4, 3/4, 3/4)

adding candidate number 1: a
 with maxmimum cost per voter q = 1/2
 remaining budget:
  (1/4, 1/4, 3/4, 3/4)
 tie broken in favor of a,
 candidates {a, c, d, e} are tied
 (all would impose a maximum cost of 1/2).

adding candidate number 2: c
 with maxmimum cost per voter q = 3/4
 remaining budget:
  (1/4, 0, 3/4, 0)
 tie broken in favor of c,
 candidates {c, d, e} are tied
 (all would impose a maximum cost of 3/4).

adding candidate number 3: e
 with maxmimum cost per voter q = 3/4
 remaining budget:
  (0, 0, 0, 0)
